#Problem Statement - Piyush Garg - Youtube

- If we are inserting/updating database after every second in a case where zomato delivery guy changing their location so our database goes down
- In that case we have higher OPS(operation per second)
- Database have very low throughput(maximum operation allowed per operation)
- same case will happend in group chat applications also (Real time Applications)

#How Kafka solve problems

Database:- Low Throughput and High Storage
Kafka- High Throughput and Low Storage
